            <h1>Three laws of robotics</h1>
            <p>Rules developed by science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov, who sought to create an ethical system for humans
                and robots.</p>

                <h2>1st Law</h2>

                <p>robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm</p>

            <section>
                <h2>2nd Law</h2>

                <p>A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with
                    the
                    First
                    Law</p>

            <section>
                <h2>3rd Law</h2>

                <p>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or
                    Second
                    Law</p>

            <p>Asimov later added another rule, known as the fourth or zeroth law, that superseded the others. It stated
                that “a robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.”</p>
